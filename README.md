# React Accordion

A simple and flexible accordion component built with React. This component allows users to toggle between single and multiple section selection modes.

## Features

- Toggle between single and multiple selections.
- Displays data from a structured list (JSON format).
- Conditionally renders content based on the user's interaction.
- Gracefully handles cases where no data is provided.

 ## React Concepts Used

This project demonstrates the use of the following React concepts:

- **useState Hook**: Used to manage the local state of the accordion (e.g., handling which section is open, toggling multiple selections).
- **Conditional Rendering**: Conditionally renders content (questions and answers) based on the user's interaction.
- **Event Handling**: Handles click events to expand or collapse sections and toggle between single or multiple selections.
- **Array Methods**: Utilizes array methods like `.map()` to dynamically render the accordion items and `.filter()` to manage the selection state in multiple mode.
- **Props and Data Passing**: Passes data into the accordion component from an external `data.js` file, simulating real-world data fetching.
